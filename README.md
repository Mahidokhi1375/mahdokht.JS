Iam learning programming by git and visual studio code 
through DR.Afsharkazemi and the teaching of MR.Samimi
after git training,jS training start
I have some information about JS lucky me 

something about JS in java there are a series of identifiers and a series of operators and a series of basic data 

I want to give and an example for a mathematical operator 
var num1=24;
var num2=100;
var res1=num1+num2;
alert(res1);
after ctrl + s
a window will open that calculates the data of the variable
